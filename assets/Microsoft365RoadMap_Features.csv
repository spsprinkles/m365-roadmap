Until now BIOS management has been proprietary per-OEM, often creating an inconsistent experience to deliver security with ease-of-deployment. With DFCI support, IT administrators gain the efficiency of cloud-scale remote firmware management with zero-touch device provisioning and built-in security. DFCI will initially apply to Surface devices, and an open-source framework will be published to enable third-party OEM partners. DFCI supports zero-touch provisioning, eliminates BIOS passwords, provides control of security settings including boot options and built-in peripherals, and lays the groundwork for advanced security scenarios in the future.","Launched","","Microsoft Intune","General Availability","Engineering","DoD, Worldwide (Standard Multi-Tenant)","2019-06-07","2021-03-30","March CY2021",

While there are still some conditions where the recall still won't happen (like the message being read by the recipient), moving the recall to the cloud significantly improves the recall success rate. Additionally, we'll now also offer an aggregate message recall status report, to make it simpler to see for whom the recall succeeded and for whom it failed.","In development","","Exchange","General Availability","","DoD, Worldwide (Standard Multi-Tenant)","2019-12-05","2021-05-05","July CY2021",
